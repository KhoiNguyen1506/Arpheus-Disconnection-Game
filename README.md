# Arpheus-Disconnection-Game
Hi everyone!!! This is just simply a replication of the Chrome's dinosaur game but the protagonist will be Orpheus. I have been coding for High Seas event recently and I decided to make this silly game as an appreciation for High Seas. Thanks to High Seas, I have learned a lot of coding skills and techniques and meet many incredible coders. Therefore, Orpheus will be the lucky guy and our game's one and only protagonist.
The rules are pretty easy. You just have to jump pass the cacti by pressing the space bar and duck when you meet a flying ptero. Lastly, I made it pretty hard so be prepared!!!!!
Hope y'all will enjoy it.
